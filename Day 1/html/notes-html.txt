    Magic square
    In recreational mathematics, a square array of numbers, usually positive integers, is called a magic square if the sums of the numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals are the same.[1][2] The 'order' of the magic square is the number of integers along one side (n), and the constant sum is called the 'magic constant'. 

    .Magic squares that include repeated entries do not fall under this definition and are referred to as 'trivial'. 
    .The mathematical study of a magic square typically deals with its construction, classification, and enumeration.
    
    1.The third-order magic square was known to Chinese mathematicians as early as 190 BCE, and explicitly given by the first century of the common era. 
    2. The first dateable instance of the fourth-order magic square occurred in 587 CE in India. 
    3. Specimens of magic squares of order 3 to 9 appear in an encyclopedia from Baghdad c.â€‰983, the Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity (Rasa'il Ikhwan al-Safa).
