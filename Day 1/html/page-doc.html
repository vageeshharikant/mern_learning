    <p>In recreational mathematics, a square array of numbers, usually positive integers, is called a magic square if
        the sums of the numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals are the same.[1][2] The 'order' of the
        magic square is the number of integers along one side (n), and the constant sum is called the 'magic constant'.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Magic squares that include repeated entries do not fall under this definition and are referred to as
            'trivial'.</li>
        <li>The mathematical study of a magic square typically deals with its construction, classification, and
            enumeration.</li>
    </ul>

        <li>The third-order magic square was known to Chinese mathematicians as early as 190 BCE, and explicitly given
            by the first century of the common era.</li>
        <li>The first dateable instance of the fourth-order magic square occurred in 587 CE in India. </li>
        <li>Specimens of magic squares of order 3 to 9 appear in an encyclopedia from Baghdad c.â€‰983, the Encyclopedia
            of the Brethren of Purity (Rasa'il Ikhwan al-Safa).</li>
